# Lesson-1 (JavaScript Basics)
## 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library.

- JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time.
- It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line.
- The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript that‚Äôs why it is called dynamically typed.

### Javascript?
- giving instructions to a computer
- the computer follows our instructions

## 2. Setup

Before we start coding in JavaScript, we need to set up our environment first.  
Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you **don‚Äôt need to install a lot of software**.  
Here‚Äôs what you need:

---

1. Install web browswer (let's us view website)

   
   ![Google-chrome](./images/Google-chrome.jpeg)

   If you don't have Google Chrome, use default browser like Microsoft Edge/Safari

2. Text Editor or IDE
   
   You‚Äôll need a place to write your code.  
   Here are a few popular choices (you can use whatever you like):  

      ‚úÖ [**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ‚Äî lightweight, powerful, and widely used.  
      ‚úÖ [**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ‚Äî fast and simple.  
      ‚úÖ [**Atom**](https://atom-editor.cc/) ‚Äî customizable and developer-friendly.

3. (Optional) Node.js ‚Äî For Running JavaScript outside the Browser

   If you want to execute JavaScript on your computer (without a webpage), you‚Äôll need **Node.js**.

      ‚úÖ Download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)  
      ‚úÖ After installation, you can run:

   ```bash
   node yourfile.js

## 3. JavaScript Syntax

   **Syntax** refers to the set of **rules and structures** that define how code should be **written** in a programming language.
   
   Every programming language ‚Äî including JavaScript ‚Äî has its own syntax.  
   This means you need to follow certain **rules** (like brackets, semicolons, and keywords) for your code to be understood by the computer.

   ## üîπ Examples:
   
   ‚úÖ Correct JavaScript (Valid Syntax):
   ```javascript
   let message = "Hello, JavaScript!";
   console.log(message);
   ```
   
   ‚ùå Incorrect JavaScript (Invalid Syntax):
   ```javascript
   let message = Hello, JavaScript!  // missing quotes
   console.log message               // missing parentheses
   ```
